# ShareHub
Full-stack cloud storage webapp (In progress)

#Frontend
> Sharehubb is a cloud storage webapp demo built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and deployed via Netlify CDN.

## Live Frontend Demo 
[Sharehubb on Netlify](https://sharehubb.netlify.app)

## Project Notes
The Settings page UI is available and can be explored in the live demo.
However, backend‑to‑frontend integration for Settings features is not fully functional.
This is intentional, as Sharehubb is presented here as a GitHub project for portfolio and resume purposes.
